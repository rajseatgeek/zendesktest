<!--
Title your issue as "Issue title", do not include any kind of square bracket category prefix

Label this issue as appropriate. Priority is the most important.

 - If the app closes or becomes unusable, please add the "crash" label
 - If the issue is critical, please label it "next release"
 - All issues should have a "module: …" label, categorized based on the section/functionality of the app the issue affects

 Module label guides for the non-obvious ones:
  - "module: infra" — used for infrastructural application changes (e.g. tickets caching rearchitecture)
  - "module: integrations" — used for core integrations with the Android platform (e.g. adding Android App Links, Android Wear support, etc)
  - "module: interactions" — used for just about anything that's a design or UX improvement (e.g. transitions, navigation changes, etc)

Each comment will explain what is needed for each section. If you need further clarification, ask anyone on the Android team.
